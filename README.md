Movie Rental Analysis is a data analysis project designed to evaluate the performance of a movie rental business with a focus on revenue analysis and film analysis. The project examines rental and payment data to understand how revenue is generated across different films and categories. It helps identify top-performing movies, popular film categories, and rental trends over time. Visualizations created using Power BI or Excel make the insights easy to understand and support better business decisions, such as improving film selection and maximizing revenue.
